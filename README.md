# go-udpserver
## A basic udp server in Golang

Works on Ubuntu 16.10.<br />
You can change your interface & listening port into the main.go file (look at the constants).<br />
You can also use my go-udpclient to interact with <br/>
If you want to try it with nc: <br/>
$ nc -u 192.168.1.yourip 5000 <br/>
Then press enter.
